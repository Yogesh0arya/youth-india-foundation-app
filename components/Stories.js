I started my journey in youth india in January 2021 as a business development member. It&apos;s been almost 7 months, and the graph of my learning experience has shown tremendous growth. With every passing day, not just on how to be a better worker or manager, but also, how to be a better person. Started in the field of public relations, marketing and business development, youth india has become the bedrock to my career. Nevertheless, it gives me the space to think and model my ideas as well as the opportunity to implement and see them in action. I believe that the potential of this foundation is beyond the seven skies and we, the youth in true sense, can make unbelievable changes, only if we believe in ourselves.</p>

It&apos;s been a year now with YIF and I can honestly say that it&apos;s been fantastic since I&apos;ve not only met friends, but also found a family. It&apos;s been a long journey that has aided my professional and personal development. I&apos;d say it was a difficult task for me to build a team, being president of Viman Nagar Society, Maharashtra but it was the one from which I learned a great day. I was promoted to National HR Director after three months. I can&apos;t even count how many things I&apos;ve learned in the last one year. The people here are absolute sweethearts and I just love working with each one of them. The organisation has really aided me in honing my leadership skills and has also shown me that I am capable of much more than I previously believed! </p>
